Description: SMART is an inter-agency initiative launched in 2002 by a network 
    of organizations and humanitarian practitioners. SMART advocates a 
    multi-partner, systematized approach to provide critical, reliable 
    information for decision-making, and to establish shared systems and 
    resources for host government partners and humanitarian organizations. The 
    SMART Methodology is an improved survey method that balances simplicity 
    (for rapid assessment of acute emergencies) and technical soundness. This
    packages provides functions to perform the various analysis used in SMART.
